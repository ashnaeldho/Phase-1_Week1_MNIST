Definition:

1. Convolution:
   It is an operation carried out between two numbers to get the resultant.
  
2. Filters/Kernels:
   It is a 3x3, 5x5, etc, matrices which is used to convolve with the input image inorder to extract the features. The kernal 
   size should be odd.
   
 3. Epochs:
    If the entire data in the training dataset is processed once, an epoch is said to be complete.
    
 4. 1x1 Convolution:
    The input is convolved with a filter of size 1x1. This is used when we want to reduce the channel size without changing the
    height and width of the image.
    
 5. 3x3 Convolution:
    he input is convolved with a filter of size 3x3.
    
 6. Feature Maps:
    A map of features is known as feature map. Features are the particular information contained in an input.
    
 7. Activation Function:
    The output for a particular input is defined by activation function.
    
 8. Receptive Field:
    During convolution, the particular portion of the input image where convolution is happening with the filter is known as the
    receptive field of that particular filter.
